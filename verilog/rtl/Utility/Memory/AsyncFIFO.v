   This is an asynchronous fifo. That means it has two independently clocked
   interfaces that allow you to write data from one clock domain and read
   it from another.
   
   This is a first-word-fall-through fifo meaning that dout is valid whenever
   empty is 0. If you want to perform a read, simply check if empty is 0 and
   if it is read the value of dout and set rget high to advance to the next
   value.
