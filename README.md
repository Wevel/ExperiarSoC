# Reference work and inspiration
[Riscduino](https://github.com/dineshannayya/riscduino): Used for inspiration and as a reference for using openlane. There are a number of similar aspects to this project, but all have been reimplemented rather than copied.
[Openlane Documentation](https://openlane-docs.readthedocs.io/en/rtd-develop/index.html): Reference for a lot of configuration. The [Variables](https://openlane-docs.readthedocs.io/en/rtd-develop/configuration/README.html) and [Hardening Macros](https://openlane-docs.readthedocs.io/en/rtd-develop/doc/hardening_macros.html#) pages have been particularity useful.
[Caravel Documentation](https://caravel-harness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): Reference for caravel and configuration.
