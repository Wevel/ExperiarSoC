Working:
	Internal UART Rx/Tx
	Core
		Instructions
			BEQ (rs1=x0, rs2=x0, imm=0)
			LUI
			ADDI
			SW
		CSRs (Memory map is for 0x1081_2xxx, but should be 0x1081_8xxx)
			cycle (upper and lower)	
			timer lower (and probably upper)
			instret lower (and probably upper)
Not working:
	SRAM
	System registers
		Memory map is for 0x1081_1xxx, but should be 0x1081_4xxx
		Incorrect index == 0 check, returns the opposite of what it should be
			management_readRegister: management_dataOut <= !management_registerIndex ? registers[management_registerIndex] : 32'b0;
			Should have used |management_registerIndex rather than !management_registerIndex
	CSRs
		timerLower, vendorID, archID, implID, coreID, and misa all use the address 0xC01
			Will return the value from timerLower
		Can't seem to write to any
